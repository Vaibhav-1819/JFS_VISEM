# JFS_VISEM

This repository contains a collection of **Maven-based Java projects** developed during my **Java Full Stack training under PAT (Placement Assistance Training)**, along with additional practice and self-learning projects.

The projects in this repository cover various concepts taught in class, including core Java, Maven project structure, backend development, and basic frontend integration. This repository acts as a **central place to store, revise, and track my learning progress** throughout the Java Full Stack journey.
